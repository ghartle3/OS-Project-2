CS 33211 Operating Systems 

Fall 2023

_Description_

Considering a system with five processes P0 through P4 and three resources of type A, B, C. Resource type A has 10 instances, B has 5 instances and type C has 7 instances. Suppose at time t0 following snapshot of the system has been taken. Use the Bankers Algorithms to determine if the system is safe, and if so provide the safe sequence. 

_Compilation_

Information read in and the compilation of the bankers algorithm all occurs together. The information comes from a provided text file that contains a unique configuration for reading in appropriate values to arrays. 

_Run instructions_

The program can be run using the manual command: 

`./HW2_OS.cpp`
